    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Yes, the more afrobeat gospel music is integrated into regular services and not relegated to the background or deemed as novelty Christian music, the more it will thrive. We all need to embrace the multi-faceted genres of Gospel Music. Know that gospel afrobeat is part of the church and the church must march forward.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>What we refer to as the modern afro gospel originated from a mix of the African sound most times credited to iconic musician/activist Fela Anikulapo Kuti. After his passing, new age artists have gone ahead in remaking the sound to blend with other modern style music including jazz, rhythm and blues, and hip hop to arrive at what we today experience as Afrobeat.</p>

    <div class="answer">
      <p>In Ephesians 5:19, the bible says to address one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart.

    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Music is made first of all to the Lord and only secondarily to each other. Music should communicate and express a sense of awe and wonder in the presence of God; it should lead our thoughts toward God rather than toward ourselves. So Gospel Afrobeat music can be played in church services and crusades.</p>
